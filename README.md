=============

#### What is it
---
A gif bot for the Hacker School Zulip.


#### Usage
---

Gif bot is intended to be very simple to use. It will only respond to messages starting with gif me or @gif bot gif me.

`gif me < QUERY >` or `@gif bot gif me < QUERY >`.

Due to popular demand, there is also an undo functionality. Simply write `undo` in the thread where the unwanted gif was posted by Gif Bot. The image will be replaced with `NOPE.`

#### Notes about Zulip API
----
I used the Zulip API [Python bindings](https://github.com/zulip/python-zulip) for this project. However, there is no binding for updating a post. To do this, I had to directly send a `PATCH` request to the Zulip messages endpoint of their API. Zulip uses BasicAuth which I wasn't aware of until speaking with one of their engineers.

**Example**

```python
payload = { 'message_id': last_message.getMsgId(msg['display_recipient'], msg['subject']), 
                            'content': 'NOPE.'
                            }
                url = "https://api.zulip.com/v1/messages"
                resp = requests.patch(url, data=payload, auth=requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth(os.environ['ZULIP_USERNAME'], os.environ['ZULIP_API_KEY']))
```

There is also no way to subscribe the bot to all of the streams without subscribing it to all individual streams. In order to achieve this, I used a console hack to list all of the streams, piped it to a text file, `subscriptions.txt`, and subscribed the bot to all streams.

#### Siblings
---

Gif bot has a sibling [meme bot](https://github.com/bruslim/zulip-meme-bot).
